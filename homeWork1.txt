     The goal of software quality assurance is to develop an acceptable software products.Here the so-called "Acceptable" Should be the users to understand In the sense of acceptance, Or should reach the user quality requirements are put forward. So the task of software quality assurance is to protect nature The software quality. 
      The major function of the SQA has the following three points: 1.To provide the right information to the management, in order to make software development correctly; 2.To collect quality data, identify and manage risk, to promote and assist in process improvement; 3.Acts as the test work of supervisors, the test work according to the established process (test plan, test cases, The test execution).
       Science of software quality assurance process generally includes the following activities: 1.First of all, establish the SQA group; 2.Second, choose and determine the SQA activities that is to choose the SQA groups of quality assurance activities. 3.And then, develop and maintain the SQA plan, the plan has been clear about the SQA activities and the whole software development life cycle. In various stages of the relationship; 4.Perform the SQA plan and to related personal training, selection and the whole software engineering environment that meet the needs of quality guarantee the tools; 5.In the end, the shortcomings in the course of perfecting the quality assurance activities, improve the project's quality assurance process. The software testing and software maintenance is the most important of the whole system of software quality assurance two components.
